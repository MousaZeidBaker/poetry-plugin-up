This package is a plugin that updates dependencies and bumps their versions in
`pyproject.toml` file. The version constraints are respected, unless the
`--latest` flag is passed, in which case dependencies are updated to latest
available compatible versions.

This plugin provides similar features as the existing `update` command with
additional features.


## Installation

The easiest way to install the `up` plugin is via the `self add` command of
Poetry.

```shell
poetry self add poetry-plugin-up
```

inject` command.

```shell
pipx inject poetry poetry-plugin-up
```

Otherwise, if you used `pip` to install Poetry you can add the plugin packages
via the `pip install` command.
